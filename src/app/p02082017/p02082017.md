### Hosting an Angular App with Firebase
The point of this blog post is to show how easy it is to
host an Angular app on Firebase. You might
consider Firebase overkill just for hosting a website, but the hosting 
actually comes with a decent 
[free tier](https://firebase.google.com/pricing/) and the tooling makes
it really easy to deploy. They also give you free SSL and allow you 
to connect a custom domain pretty easily. 

So on to the process of deployment. 
I'm assuming you are starting a new app and are using
the [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

Create a new application with the CLI
``` bash
ng new myapp
cd myapp
```

Build the App
``` bash
ng build --target=production --aot
```

The cli stores build articfacts in a `dist` directory by default. We'll
use that to deploy our app. We use the 
[production](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/build#bundling--tree-shaking) 
target and [aot](https://angular.io/guide/aot-compiler) 
options so that the CLI does some optimizations. 

Install the firebase tools
``` bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

Login to firebase
``` bash
firebase login
```

Deploy the app
``` bash
firebase deploy
```

And that's it!
